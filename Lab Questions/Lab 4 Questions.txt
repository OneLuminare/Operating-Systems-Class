Lab 4 Questions
===============
1. In a virtualization system like VMware, the guest OS is a virtual OS that sits on top of the actual hardware
OS, the host OS. The guest OS does not know its a virtual os, it has access to its own set of resources like 
memory and I/0, but an application between the guest and the host OS does address translation. Important factors
when choosing a Host OS are speed ( multiple core processors, and preferably 64 bit) to manage many guest OS's, 
large amount of memory to increase memory available to each guest os, stability to keep running, and security 
to keep users from accessing or doing things they shouldn't.
