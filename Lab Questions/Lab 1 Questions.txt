Lab 1 Questions

1. Some advantages of using the different system call interfaces for files and device are:
	- Devices and file system calls can have varying execution times do to down time in I/O, so
	  each system call interface can be executed parallel to increase performance.
	- Encapsulates functionality which is better programming practice.
   Some disadvantages are:
    - Would require specifying which system call interface to be called to be specified, or have
	  a piece of code in between determine it.
2. Yes, a new shell could be programmed  using the system call interface provided by the operating system. It would not be
   much different then writing any other application, as long as one had knowledge to set up the appropriate parameters for each
   system call, knowing the sequence of systems calls to make, then make the call to enter kernel mode and execute it. 
   By editing the bootstrap, the new shell could be set up to run at boot up.
